# Income and Education Gaps in Toronto

## Summary of Findings
Education is a contributor to many beneficial socio-economic outcomes. We intend to exam the education profile in the selected neighbourhoods of Toronto that have polarized household income from the data set package *Wellbeing Toronto - Demographics: NHS Indicators*. We first observe that the income gap between the neighbourhood with the highest household income and the lowest is enormous. The median household income of Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills is almost nine times more than Regent Park before tax. Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills also has a much higher attainment rate (45%) of higher education above a bachelor's degree than Regent Park (23%) and the City of Toronto (27%). We intend to use the comparison to bring awareness of inequality in income and education existing in the City of Toronto.

## Data: Wellbeing Toronto - Demographics: NHS Indicators
*Wellbeing Toronto - Demographics: NHS Indicators* provides information from the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS) and presents a profile of Toronto across 140 neighbourhoods. There are two data sets in this package used in the analysis: _Demographics NHS Indicators 2011_ and _Education NHS Indicators 2011_. In _Demographics NHS Indicators 2011_, the indicators we are interested in are *Median household total income* and *Median after-tax household income*, which show the median household income of every neighbourhood before and after tax is applied. We identify the neighbourhood with the highest median household income (Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills) and the neighbourhood with the lowest median household income (Regent Park). We then calculate the median household income of Toronto as summary statistics.
